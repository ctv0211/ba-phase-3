This will be done in the setting of RuleML. The task of monitoring contract execution and performance requires a logical account of deontic and defeasible aspects of legal language; currently such aspects are not covered by RuleML; accordingly we show how to extend it to cover such notions. From its logical form, the contract will be thus transformed into a machine readable rule notation and eventually implemented as executable semantics via any mark-up languages depending on the client’s preference, for contract monitoring purposes.

this does not fit well with the autonomous nature of services. Therefore, 
we propose DecSerFlow as a Declarative Service Flow Language. DecSerFlow can be used to specify, enact, and monitor service flows. The

process design. In this paper, our objective is twofold. We will firstly present a 
research agenda in the space of business process compliance, identifying major 
technical and organizational challenges. We then tackle a part of the overall 
problem space, which deals with the effective modeling of control objectives 
and subsequently their propagation onto business process models. Control 
objective modeling is proposed through a specialized modal logic based on 
normative systems theory, and the visualization of control objectives on 
business process models is achieved procedurally. The proposed approach is

already developed to ensure system correctness after arbitrary process changes at the syntactical level (e.g., avoiding inconsistencies such as deadlocks or missing input parameters after a process change). However, errors may be still caused at the 
semantical level (e.g., violation of business rules). Therefore, the integration and verification of domain knowledge will flag 
a milestone in the development of adaptive process management technology. In this paper, we introduce a framework for 
defining semantic constraints over processes in such a way that they can express real-world domain knowledge on the one 
hand and are still manageable concerning the effort for maintenance and semantic process verification on the other hand. 
This can be used to detect semantic conflicts (e.g., drug incompatibilities) when modeling process templates, applying ad 
hoc changes at process instance level, and propagating process template modifications to already running process 
instances, even if they have been already individually modified themselves; i.e., we present techniques to ensure semantic 
correctness for single and concurrent changes which are, in addition, minimal regarding the set of semantic constraints to 
be checked. Together with further optimizations of the semantic checks based on certain process meta model properties 
this allows for efficiently verifying processes. Altogether, the framework presented in this paper provides the basis for process management systems which are adaptive and semantic-aware at the same time.

compliance leads to loss of competitive advantage and thus loss of market share. 
Unlike the classical domain-independent behavioral correctness of business 
processes, compliance requirements are domain-specific. Moreover, compliance 
requirements change over time. New requirements might appear due to change in 
laws and adoption of new policies. Compliance requirements are offered or enforced 
by different entities that have different objectives behind these requirements. Finally, 
compliance requirements might affect different aspects of business processes, e.g., 
control flow and data flow. As a result, it is infeasible to hard-code compliance 
checks in tools. Rather, a repeatable process of modeling compliance rules and 
checking them against business processes automatically is needed. 
This thesis provides a formal approach to support process design-time compliance checking. Using visual patterns, it is possible to model compliance requirements concerning control flow, data flow and conditional flow rules. Each 
pattern is mapped into a temporal logic formula. The thesis addresses the problem 
of consistency checking among various compliance requirements, as they might 
stem from divergent sources. Also, the thesis contributes to automatically check 
compliance requirements against process models using model checking. We show 
that extra domain knowledge, other than expressed in compliance rules, is needed 
to reach correct decisions. 
In case of violations, we are able to provide a useful feedback to the user. The 
feedback is in the form of parts of the process model whose execution causes the 
violation. In some cases, our approach is capable of providing automated remedy of 
the violation. ";finished +

compliance, the verification of process models against compliance rules

compliance checking has to support data-aware compliance rules as well 
as to consider data conditions within a process model. Independently of 
the actual technique applied to accomplish compliance checking, dataawareness means that in addition to the control flow dimension, the data 
dimension has to be explored during compliance checking. However, naive 
exploration of the data dimension can lead to state explosion. We address 
this issue by introducing an abstraction approach in this paper. We show 
how state explosion can be avoided by conducting compliance checking 
for an abstract process model and abstract compliance rules. Our abstraction approach can serve as preprocessing step to the actual compliance 
checking and provides the basis for more efficient application of existing

organizations. Despite an increasing number of methods and tools, organizations are still facing difficulties in 
finding effective support to ensure that their business processes comply with the requirements set forth by 
regulations, laws, standards, etc. While manual solutions offer limited assurance for compliance, there is a 
lack of a comprehensive framework for semi-automatically managing compliance requirements and ensuring 
compliance throughout all the phases of business process lifecycle. One of the foundational building blocks of 
such a framework is a generic conceptual model that supports factoring compliance and its relation to 
business processes. This paper introduces a compliance conceptual model to capture and manage 
compliance requirements and to relate them to business processes in a transparent and verifiable manner. 
The model also incorporates a set of patterns to facilitate the specification of formal compliance rules to be 
used for automated compliance verification and monitoring. We have developed a set of integrated tools that

Many contributions involve extracting legal requirements, providing law-compliant business processes, as well as managing 
and maintaining compliance. In this paper, we report on a 
systematic literature review focusing on goal-oriented legal 
compliance of business processes. 88 papers were selected out 
of nearly 800 unique papers extracted from five search engines, 
with manual additions from the Requirements Engineering 
Journal and four relevant conferences. We grouped these 
papers in eight categories based on a set of criteria and 
then highlight their main contributions. We found that the 
main areas for contributions have been in extracting legal 
requirements, modeling them with goal modeling languages, 
and integrating them with business processes. We identify gaps 
and opportunities for future work in areas related to prioritization to improve compliance, templates for generating lawcompliant processes, general links between legal requirements, 
goal models, and business processes, and semi-automation of 
legal compliance and analysis.

Thus, a comprehensive compliance management framework is required such 
that compliance management must crosscut all the stages of the complete business process lifecycle, starting from the very early stages of business process 
design. Formalizing compliance requirements based on a formal foundation of 
an expressive logical language enables the application of associated verification 
and analysis tools to ensure the compliance. In this paper, we have conducted a 
comparative analysis between three languages that can be used as the formal 
foundation of business process compliance requirements, focusing on designtime phase. Two main families of languages have been identified, which are: 
the temporal and deontic families of logic. In particular, we have considered 
LTL, CTL and FCL. The comparative analysis is based on the capabilities and 
limitations of each language and a set of required identified features.

in a particular rule language such as SBVR, or OCL, as

result in erroneous business rules. In this paper, we propose 
an automated approach that automatically translates the NL

challenge in NL to SBVR translation was complex semantic

processes are often driven by and documented using process models. Nowadays, process models are also applied to 
drive process execution. Thus, correctness of business process models is a must. Much of the work has been devoted 
to check general, domain-independent correctness criteria, such as soundness. However, business processes must 
also adhere to and show compliance with various regulations and constraints, the so called compliance requirements. 
These are domain-dependent requirements. 
In many situations, verifying compliance on a model level is of great value, since violations can be resolved in 
an early stage prior to execution. However, this calls for using formal verification techniques, e.g., model checking, 
that are too complex for business experts to apply. In this paper, we utilize a visual language, BPMN-Q, to express 
compliance requirements visually in a way similar to that used by business experts to build process models. Still, using 
a pattern based approach, each BPMN-Q graph has a formal temporal logic expression in computational tree logic 
(CTL). Moreover, the user is able to express constraints, i.e., compliance rules, regarding control flow and data flow 
aspects. In order to provide valuable feedback to a user in case of violations, we depend on temporal logic querying 
approaches as well as BPMN-Q to visually highlight paths in a process model whose execution causes violations.

rules, distributed respectively over 10 and 7 categories. In addition we present 
how temporal compliance requirements discussed in literature can be unified and 
formalized using a generic temporal compliance rule. 
To check compliance with respect to a compliance rule, the event log describing 
the observed behavior is aligned with the corresponding rule. The alignment then 
shows which events occurred out of specified order and which events deviated by 
which amount of time from the prescribed behavior. The approach is flexible (easy 
to express new rules), and allowing for multi-perspective diagnostic information 
in case of compliance violations. The technique and corresponding tool support 
have been experimentally validated using a case study.

and design to deployment, monitoring and evaluation. In this paper, a taxonomy of 
compliance constraints for business processes is introduced based on the notion of compliance patterns. Patterns facilitate the formal specification of compliance constraints 
that enable their verification and analysis against business process models. This taxonomy serves as the backbone of the root-cause analysis, which is conducted to reason 
about and eventually to resolve design-time compliance violations, by providing appropriate guidelines as remedies to alleviate design-time compliance deviations. We have 
developed and integrated a set of tools to observe and evaluate the applicability of our 
approach, and experiment with it in case studies.

and more important aspect in business processes management. Compliance requirements are usually formulated in a set of rules that can be checked during or after the 
execution of the business process, called compliance by detection. If noncompliant 
behavior is detected, the business process needs to be redesigned. Alternatively, the 
rules can be already taken into account while modeling the business process to result in 
a business process that is compliant by design. This technique has the advantage that a 
subsequent verification of compliance is not required. 
This paper focuses on compliance by design and employs an artifact-centric 
approach. In this school of thought, business processes are not described as a sequence 
of tasks to be performed (i.e., imperatively), but from the point of view of the artifacts 
that are manipulated during the process (i.e., declaratively). We extend the artifactcentric approach to model compliance rules and show how compliant business 
processes can be synthesized automatically";

need to show that operational processes are executed in a controlled manner while
satisfying predefined (legal) requirements or service level agreements. Deviations
may be costly and expose an organization to severe risks. Compliance checking
is of growing importance for the business process management and auditing communities. This paper presents an approach for checking compliance of observed
process executions recorded in an event log to temporal compliance requirements,
which restrict when particular activities may or may not occur. We show how
temporal compliance requirements discussed in literature can be unified and formalized using a generic temporal compliance rule. To check compliance with respect to a temporal rule, the event log describing the observed behavior is aligned
with the rule. The alignment then shows which events occurred out of order and
which events deviated by which amount of time from the prescribed behavior.
This approach integrates with an existing approach for control-flow compliance
checking, allowing for multi-perspective diagnostic information in case of compliance violations. We show the feasibility of our technique by checking temporal
compliance rules of real life event logs.

appears between the desire to control processes for avoiding undesirable executions, and 
the flexibility that users need in order to attain their higher level goals. While this is a 
general trend in general business processes, it is even more acute in specific domains like 
the medical area, where the clinical guidelines are expected to contribute to the 
optimization of medical assistance. 
Objective: We study model checking as support for understanding and solving the 
inconsistencies between the process models and their corresponding execution. The aim 
is to provide various human users with output in controlled English for the checking of 
properties about the execution of such processes, and perhaps input in controlled English 
for properties of interest from the point of view of the user. 
Method: For the conformance checking of such complex situations, we use an 
extended version of a Hybrid Logics model checking tool, for the verification of various 
properties within an abstract representation model. The extension with Description Logics 
helps to exploit a more refined representation of the entities involved in the execution of 
processes. The advantages of using the model checker in visualizing and verbalizing 
connections of the properties checked with their dependencies over time are shown on a 
sore throat running scenario, relative to its corresponding clinical guidelines. 
Results: With new data for an alternative run of the execution, our method can update 
the abstract model to enable the user to see what might happen or might have happened 
in such runs of the process model. The new updated abstract model corresponding to the 
new real situations is then used to analyze whether the overall state is acceptable or 
should further actions be considered to arrive at an acceptable state of the world. 
Conclusion: Our results show how the combination of Hybrid Logic and Description 
Logic can provide the necessary abstraction for the checking to be carried out at a level 
understandable by the human user when the properties of interest can be translated by a 
controlled English language interface.";finished +

p.476-477";"Analyzing conceptual models such as process models, data models, or organizational charts is useful for several 
purposes in information systems engineering (e.g., for business process improvement, compliance management, 
model driven software development, and software alignment). To analyze conceptual models structurally and 
semantically, so-called model query languages have been put forth. Model query languages take a model pattern and 
conceptual models as input and return all subsections of the models that match this pattern. Existing model query 
languages typically focus on a single modeling language and/or application area (such as analysis of execution 
semantics of process models), are restricted in their expressive power of representing model structures, and/or 
abstain from graphical pattern specification. Because these restrictions may hamper query languages from 
propagating into practice, we close this gap by proposing a modeling language-spanning structural model query 
language based on flexible graph search that, hence, provides high structural expressive power. To address ease-ofuse, it allows one to specify model queries using a diagram. In this paper, we present the syntax and the semantics of 
the diagramed model query language (DMQL), a corresponding search algorithm, an implementation as a modeling 
tool prototype, and a performance evaluation.

for conformance checking should not only describe the process behavior from the control flow point of

that compliance management is a daunting task, and organizations are still struggling and spending billions of dollars annually to ensure and prove their compliance. In this 
paper, we introduce a comprehensive compliance management framework with a main focus on design-time compliance management as a first step towards a preventive lifetime 
compliance support. The framework enables the automation 
of compliance-related activities that are amenable to automation, and therefore can significantly reduce the expenditures 
spent on compliance. It can help experts to carry out their 
work more efficiently, cut the time spent on tedious manual 
activities, and reduce potential human errors. An evident candidate compliance activity for automation is the compliance 
checking, which can be achieved by utilizing formal reasoning and verification techniques. However, formal languages 
are well known of their complexity as only versed users in mathematical theories and formal logics are able to use and 
understand them. However, this is generally not the case with 
business and compliance practitioners. Therefore, in the heart 
of the compliance management framework, we introduce the 
Compliance Request Language (CRL), which is formally 
grounded on temporal logic and enables the abstract patternbased specification of compliance requirements. CRL constitutes a series of compliance patterns that spans three structural facets of business processes; control flow, employed 
resources and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, CRL supports the specification of compensations and non-monotonic 
requirements, which permit the relaxation of some compliance requirements to handle exceptional situations. An integrated tool suite has been developed as an instantiation artefact, and the validation of the approach is undertaken in several directions, which includes internal validity, controlled 
experiments, and functional testing.

""The eCRG language allows domain experts to capture compliance requirements at both an abstract and a visual level...""";"A fundamental challenge for enterprises is to ensure compliance of 
their business processes with imposed compliance rules stemming from various 
sources, e.g., corporate guidelines, best practices, standards, and laws. In general, a compliance rule may refer to multiple process perspectives including 
control flow, time, data, resources, and interactions with business partners. 
On one hand, compliance rules should be comprehensible for domain experts 
who must define, verify and apply them. On the other, these rules should have 
a precise semantics to avoid ambiguities and enable their automated processing. Providing a visual language is advantageous in this context as it allows 
hiding formal details and offering an intuitive way of modeling the compliance rules. However, existing visual languages for compliance rule modeling 
have focused on the control flow perspective so far, but lack proper support 
for the other process perspectives. To remedy this drawback, this paper introduces the extended Compliance Rule Graph language, which enables the 
visual modeling of compliance rules with the support of multiple perspectives. 
Overall, this language will foster the modeling and verification of compliance 
rules in practice.

Explanation: The authors stress that textual descriptions are used to make process information accessible to stakeholders who are not experts in process modeling.
This includes business users, analysts, and domain experts who may not read BPMN fluently.

“The purpose is to make process information accessible to various stakeholders, including those who are not familiar with reading and interpreting the complex execution logic of process models.” (p. 447)";"Many organizations maintain textual process descriptions alongside graphical process 
models. The purpose is to make process information accessible to various stakeholders, 
including those who are not familiar with reading and interpreting the complex execution 
logic of process models. Despite this merit, there is a clear risk that model and text 
become misaligned when changes are not applied to both descriptions consistently. For 
organizations with hundreds of different processes, the effort required to identify and 
clear up such conflicts is considerable. To support organizations in keeping their process 
descriptions consistent, we present an approach to automatically identify inconsistencies 
between a process model and a corresponding textual description. Our approach detects 
cases where the two process representations describe activities in different orders and 
detect process model activities not contained in the textual description. A quantitative 
evaluation with 53 real-life model-text pairs demonstrates that our approach accurately 
identifies inconsistencies between model and text";finished

technique to align process models and textual descriptions is proposed. The 
technique is grounded on projecting knowledge extracted from these two representations into a uniform representation that is amenable for comparison. It 
applies a tailored linguistic analysis of each description, so that the important 
information is considered when aligning description’ elements. Compared to 
existing approaches that address this use case, our technique provides more 
comprehensive alignments, which encompass process model activities, events,

medium scale enterprises (SMSE) in developing countries do not have an efficient 
compliance checking mechanism to make their business processes compliant with 
these regulatory standards. This checking mechanism is needed to give the enterprises full assurance of complete adherence to regulatory standards, bodies, or 
Service Level Agreements. Therefore, a structured and efficient compliance management model is needed to aid SMSE in launching their businesses safely and to 
ensure business processes fit into the classical regulatory standards. This paper 
presents a business rules compliance checking model and architecture for SMSEs in 
developing countries to verify and monitor their business process models at design 
time and at run time. It involves a systematic compliance requirements classification 
and analysis that employs a goal based requirement engineering approach prior to 
design time verification. It also introduces the idea and demonstration of network 
analysis for runtime business processes monitoring. The business process model 
will be verified at design time using a Simple PROMELA Interpreter model checker 
through Linear Temporal Logic rules. The approaches were tested on a financial institution in Nigeria, a developing nation in Africa at the time of this research. In 
order to ensure that the choice of the requirements analysis approach was efficient, a 
number of standard metrics for evaluating requirements engineering techniques 
were used and promising results were obtained. We also carried out a comparative 
analysis of the proposed approach in this paper with the approaches of previous 
research papers. This approach proved to be effective in terms of clarity, simplicity,

form of sets of required permissions and regulatory requirements in the form of 
deontic concepts, and present their translation into Answer Set Programming (via

The result of the compliance checking is either a positive compliance result or 
an explanation pertaining to the aspects of the policy that are causing the noncompliance. The pipeline is illustrated using two (key) fragments of the General 
Data Protect Regulation, namely Articles 6 (Lawfulness of processing) and Articles 46 (Transfers subject to appropriate safeguards) and industrially-relevant use 
cases that involve the specification of sets of permissions that are needed to execute business processes. The core contributions of this paper are the ODRL profile, which is capable of modelling regulatory obligations and business policies, 
the exercise of modelling elements of GDPR in this semantic formalism, and the 
operationalisation of the model to demonstrate its capability to support personal

for process analysis and improvement. Since the manual elicitation and 
creation of process models is a time-intensive endeavor, a variety of techniques have been developed that automatically derive process models from 
textual process descriptions. However, these techniques, so far, only focus 
on the extraction of traditional, imperative process models. The extraction of declarative process models, which allow to effectively capture complex process behavior in a compact fashion, has not been addressed. In 
this paper we close this gap by presenting the first automated approach 
for the extraction of declarative process models from natural language. 
To achieve this, we developed tailored Natural Language Processing techniques that identify activities and their inter-relations from textual constraint descriptions. A quantitative evaluation shows that our approach 
is able to generate constraints that closely resemble those established by 
humans. Therefore, our approach provides automated support for an otherwise tedious and complex manual endeavor.

business process compliance requirements management are 
model checking, patterns, semantic, formal, ontology, goalbased requirements analysis and network analysis. The 
traditional business environment has been put into consideration more than the cloud environment. The summary 
of research contributions revealed that the approaches have 
been more of formal techniques compared to model

according to the rules that enforce the compliance controls that govern the company. We faced the challenge of building a Business 
Process Compliance Management System (BPCMS) for a process-aware organisation that had to provide support for several needs 
that, despite having been identified in the literature, were only partially satisfied by existing approaches. The variability in the types of 
rules and their interpretation generally restricts the existing support for compliance checking to specific types of rules (e.g., rules 
affecting the control flow of the process), a specific phase of the business process management (BPM) lifecycle (e.g., design time or 
run time), or certain information systems (ISs) for data retrieval (e.g., process event logs). Motivated by this, we designed a conceptual 
framework for design-time and run-time compliance checking that relies on the use of mashups for rule specification and checking. It 
presents the following advantages: (i) an open-ended set of types rules can be specified by designing and connecting mashup 
components; (ii) (parts of) the definitions of the rules can be reused as needed; and (iii) the mashup-based compliance checking (MCC) 
system can be integrated with ISs of the organisation, enabling the verification of actual facts on actions performed during the execution 
of a process (e.g., the existence of a specific document in a concrete location). Design-time and run-time implementations of the 
framework were conducted and tested in a real setting.

“Our work supports companies to cope with frequent changes of regulations and of process models through automated support.” (p. 202)";"Implementing regulatory documents is a recurring, mostly 
manual and time-consuming task for companies. To establish and ensure 
regulatory compliance, constraints need to be extracted from the documents and integrated into process models capturing existing operational practices. Since regulatory documents and processes are subject to 
frequent change, the constant comparison between both is mandatory. 
Additionally, new regulations must be integrated and checked against 
existing process models. To address these challenges, we provide an approach that uses natural language processing to automatically support 
compliance assessment between regulatory documents and process model 
repositories. The outcome is a pairwise matching between parts of a regulatory document and process models from a repository. This matching 
can be used to either determine the coverage of regulations by a process 
model or to guide compliance assessment by ranking models based on 
their fitness and cost. The approach is implemented and applied in two 
real-world case studies: one from the energy domain and the other based 
on the General Data Protection Regulation.

Worse, hard-wired compliant processes are difficult to change when laws 
change, and this occurs very often. This paper proposes a model-driven 
approach to process compliance and combines a) reference models from 
laws, and b) business process models. Both reference and process models 
are expressed in a declarative process language, The Dynamic Condition 
Response (DCR) graphs. They are subject to testing and verification, 
allowing law practitioners to check consistency against the intent of the 
law. Compliance checking is a combination of alignments between events 
in laws and events in a process model. In this way, a reference model 
can be used to check different process variants. Moreover, changes in 
the reference model due to law changes do not necessarily invalidate 
existing processes, allowing their reuse and adaptation. We exemplify 
the framework via the alignment of laws and business rules and a real 
contract change management process, Finally, we show how compliance 
checking for declarative processes is decidable, and provide a polynomial 
time approximation that contrasts NP complexity algorithms used in 
compliance checking for imperative business processes. All-together, this 
paper presents technical and methodological steps that are being used

process models against rules. While traditionally compliance checking focuses on well-structured processes, we address case 
management scenarios. In case management, knowledge workers drive multi-variant and adaptive processes. Our contribution 
is based on the fragment-based case management approach, which splits a process into a set of fragments. The fragments are 
synchronized through shared data but can, otherwise, be dynamically instantiated and executed. We formalize case models 
using Petri nets. We demonstrate the formalization for design-time and run-time compliance checking and present a proofof-concept implementation. The application of the implemented compliance checking approach to a use case exemplifies its 
effectiveness while designing a case model. The empirical evaluation on a set of case models for measuring the performance 
of the approach shows that rules can often be checked in less than a second.

Manual 
compliance checking is challenging because there are numerous requirements with 
changing nature and different purposes. Despite the importance of automated techniques, there is not any systematic study in this field. This lack may hinder organizations from moving toward automated compliance checking practices. In this paper, 
we characterize the methods for automatic compliance checking of software processes, including used techniques, potential impacts, and challenges. For this, we 
undertake a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies reporting methods in this 
field. As a result, we identify solutions that use different techniques (e.g., anthologies 
and metamodels) to represent processes and their artifacts (e.g., tasks and roles). Various languages, which have diverse capabilities for managing competing and changing 
norms, and agile strategies, are also used to represent normative requirements. Most 
solutions require tool-support concretization and enhanced capabilities to handle 
processes and normative diversity. Our findings outline compelling areas for future 
research. In particular, there is a need to select suitable languages for consolidating a 
generic and normative-agnostic solution, increase automation levels, tool support, 
and boost the application in practice by improving usability aspects.

concerns the restricted visibility of the partner processes at the presence of global compliance rules

correct and lossless. The algorithm exploits transitivity properties of the underlying rule specification,

compliance management frameworks (CMFs), compliance languages and systems have emerged,

to best fulfil the organisation’s internal requirements. This is due to the lack of acceptable compliance 
tools and methodologies in the compliance domain to uncover and compare the multidimensionality 
of capability between different frameworks and users’ needs, which give raise to the question of how 
to formally evaluate a CMF. In this paper, we propose methodologies to formally evaluate CMFs,

present the formal evaluation of two prominent formal language-based CMFs, namely, PENELOPE

enable developing legally compliant software. Current software systems rely heavily on data, some of which can 
be confidential, personal, or sensitive. To address the growing concerns about data protection and privacy, the 
general data protection regulation (GDPR) has been introduced in the European Union (EU). Organizations, 
whether based in the EU or not, must comply with GDPR as long as they collect or process personal data of 
EU residents. Breaching GDPR can be charged with large fines reaching up to up to billions of euros. Privacy 
policies (PPs) and data processing agreements (DPAs) are documents regulated by GDPR to ensure, among 
other things, secure collection and processing of personal data. Such regulated documents can be used to elicit 
legal requirements that are inline with the organizations’ data protection policies. As a prerequisite to elicit a 
complete set of legal requirements, however, these documents must be compliant with GDPR. Checking the 
compliance of regulated documents entirely manually is a laborious and error-prone task. As we elaborate below, 
this dissertation investigates utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to provide automated support for 
compliance checking against GDPR. 
• AI-enabled Automation for Compliance Checking of PPs: PPs are technical documents stating the 
multiple privacy-related requirements that a system should satisfy in order to help individuals make 
informed decisions about sharing their personal data. We devise an automated solution that leverages 
natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), two sub-fields of AI, for checking the 
compliance of PPs against the applicable provisions in GDPR. Specifically, we create a comprehensive 
conceptual model capturing all information types pertinent to PPs and we further define a set of compliance 
criteria for the automated compliance checking of PPs. 
• NLP-based Automation for Compliance Checking of DPAs: DPAs are legally binding agreements 
between different organizations involved in the collection and processing of personal data to ensure that 
personal data remains protected. Using NLP semantic analysis technologies, we develop an automated 
solution that checks at phrasal-level the compliance of DPAs against GDPR. Our solution is able to provide 
not only a compliance assessment, but also detailed recommendations about avoiding GDPR violations. 
• ML-enabled Automation for Compliance Checking of DPAs: To understand how different representations of GDPR requirements and different enabling technologies fare against one another, we develop an 
automated solution that utilizes a combination of conceptual modeling and ML. We further empirically 
compare the resulting solution with our previously proposed solution, which uses natural language to 
represent GDPR requirements and leverages rules alongside NLP semantic analysis for the automated 
support. ";finished +

While in other areas of business process modelling and execution, considerable progress towards 
automation has been made (e.g., process discovery, executable process models), the interpretation 
and implementation of compliance requirements is still a highly complex task requiring human 
effort and time. To increase the level of “mechanization” when implementing regulations in business 
processes, compliance research seeks to formalize compliance requirements. Formal representations 
of compliance requirements should, then, be leveraged to design correct process models and, ideally, would also serve for the automated detection of violations. To formally specify compliance 
requirements, however, multiple process perspectives, such as control flow, data, time and resources, 
have to be considered. This leads to the challenge of representing such complex constraints which 
affect different process perspectives. To this end, current approaches in business process compliance 
make use of a varied set of languages. However, every approach has been devised based on different 
assumptions and motivating scenarios. In addition, these languages and their presentation usually 
abstract from real-world requirements which often would imply introducing a substantial amount 
of domain knowledge and interpretation, thus hampering the evaluation of their expressiveness. 
This is a serious problem, since comparisons of different formal languages based on real-world 
compliance requirements are lacking, meaning that users of such languages are not able to make 
informed decisions about which language to choose. To close this gap and to establish a uniform 
evaluation basis, we introduce a running example for evaluating the expressiveness and complexity of 
compliance rule languages. For language selection, we conducted a literature review. Next, we briefly 
introduce and demonstrate the languages’ grammars and vocabularies based on the representation 
of a number of legal requirements. In doing so, we pay attention to semantic subtleties which we 
evaluate by adopting a normative classification framework which differentiates between different 
deontic assignments. Finally, on top of that, we apply Halstead’s well-known metrics for calculating 
the relevant characteristics of the different languages in our comparison, such as the volume, difficulty 
and effort for each language. With this, we are finally able to better understand the lexical complexity 
of the languages in relation to their expressiveness. In sum, we provide a systematic comparison 
of different compliance rule languages based on real-world compliance requirements which may 
inform future users and developers of these languages. Finally, we advocate for a more user-aware 
development of compliance languages which should consider a trade off between expressiveness, 
complexity and usability.

of their goals, on the other hand, they also need to abide by the set of laws that rule the organization. The term business process compliance refers to 
the alignment of business processes and their regulations. The literature reports several frameworks to achieve process compliance, with the earliest 
citation in 1981. We focus on rigorous frameworks using formal methods to verify or ensure business process compliance. A work that collects, 
abstracts, and synthesizes an in-depth summary of the current literature will help develop research in this field. Objective: We conducted a systematic 
literature review (SLR) focusing on process compliance frameworks based on formal models in the existing literature to understand better the state 
of the research on process model compliance, and identify the gaps and opportunities for future research. Method: We used automated search 
engines to collect studies between 1981 and the establishment of GDPR using standardized electronic libraries. Out of 5018 publications retrieved 
initially, we selected 46 primary studies for thorough analysis. We identified, analyzed, and categorized compliance frameworks based on their 
phases, process and compliance languages utilized, and reasoning techniques employed. We also analyzed evidence provided by the applicability 
of each framework: what case studies compliance frameworks have been tested on, what kind of users have utilized each framework, and what 
competencies are required to achieve compliance. We assessed the maturity level for each framework based on their phases, and users considered. 
Results: Our analysis identifies a major agreement regarding verification techniques at the core of process compliance, but less so in phases before 
or after this. Concerning the techniques used, model checking is the de facto technique, but the nature of compliance and process languages utilized 
have changed. Finally, most works presented only conceptual results with prototypical implementations, do not consider actual users coming from 
compliance departments (e.g.: legal specialists), and most of the works do not consider changes in laws. Conclusions: The existing research calls 
for comprehensive empirical studies to contribute to a better understanding of the anatomy and maturity of regulatory compliance frameworks 
and for extensive evaluation methods where compliance frameworks could be benchmarked. Our study is a comprehensive source for researchers 
working on the compliance of process models against laws and related fields and a useful guide for practitioners aiming to generate compliant

was created via sustainably executed business processes. To help companies 
prepare to assess whether their business processes comply with the constraints 
outlined in the taxonomy, we investigate in how far these criteria can be 
used for conformance checking, that is, assessing in a data-driven manner, 
whether business process executions adhere to regulatory constraints. For 
this, we develop a few-shot learning pipeline to characterize the constraints 
of the taxonomy with the help of an LLM as to the process dimensions they 
relate to. We find that many constraints of the taxonomy are useable for 
conformance checking, particularly in the sectors of energy, manufacturing, 
and transport. This will aid companies in preparing to monitor regulatory 
compliance with the taxonomy automatically, by characterizing what kind of 
information they need to extract, and by providing a better understanding 
of sectors where such an assessment is feasible and where it is not.

GRL) is a promising conceptual modeling approach for supporting regulatory compliance analysis. Yet, despite early attempts at automation, 
such Legal GRL models are still manually created, being time consuming and error prone. Recent work has demonstrated how Large Language 
Models can support the creation of conceptual models. Although showing 
promise, the application scenarios for conceptual modeling are often limited to well structured, and scoped, scenarios. Dealing with practical, less 
controlled, regulatory analyses, whereby often a particular actor or topic 
needs to be pulled into focus, is an open issue. In this paper, we propose 
using prompt templates to structure the process of using LLMs to create 
a Legal GRL model from text. The core idea is that prompt templates are 
created from state of the art prompt patterns, which can restrict LLM 
output, can manage a LLM conversation context, and can structure a 
LLM conversation. We report on an initial assessment of prompt templates on multiple law articles from the healthcare and energy community 
domains. Our initial results are promising for Legal GRL modeling, but 
at the same time show that caution is warranted.

few years. Based on a preliminary study, we identified that within the field of requirements engineering (RE), NLP is widely applied and has the potential for much 
benefit in the industry. However, no clear overview is available on what tools in 
the field use NLP. Therefore, this research aims to establish the current state of research on how NLP is currently being used in RE, specifically within the phases of requirements elicitation (collecting requirements from stakeholders and other sources) 
and requirements analysis (further processing these requirements for understanding 
them better). 
The main research method used in the thesis is the Systematic Literature Review 
(SLR). An SLR involves collecting a large amount of literature according to a preestablished protocol, selecting relevant papers from this collection, assessing their 
quality, and finally extracting data from this final list of literature. From this data, we 
established purposes of the tools that are available in the field, as well as categories 
of tasks that employ NLP techniques. We also performed statistical analysis using 
Jaccard Indices to see if any patterns of co-occurrence between RE (sub-)phases, tool 
purposes and NLP tasks could be discovered. 
We conclude by explaining that though NLP is in the lift within the field, it is far 
from mature. NLP tasks are predominantly used to analyze the requirements; however, requirements documentation has the potential for more use of NLP techniques.

expression of business contracts into candidate business 
activities and processes while ensuring their compliance 
with contract. This is a progressive refinement using logicbased formalism to capture contract semantics and to serve 
as an intermediate step for transformation. Particular value 
of this approach is for those organisations that consider 
moving towards new approaches to enterprise contract 
management and applying them to their future contracts.

Despite the numerous approaches tackling the problem of moving from 
a natural language legal text to the respective set of machine-readable 
conditions, results are still unsatisfiable and it remains a major open challenge. In this paper, we propose a preliminary approach which combines 
different Natural Language Processing techniques towards the extraction 
of rules from legal documents. More precisely, we combine the linguistic 
information provided by WordNet together with a syntax-based extraction of rules from legal texts, and a logic-based extraction of dependencies between chunks of such texts. Such a combined approach leads to a 
powerful solution towards the extraction of machine-readable rules from 
legal documents. We evaluate the proposed approach over the Australian

These are based on GDPR definitions and are represented in the BPMN process models.;"In an increasingly digital world, where processing and exchange of personal data are key parts of everyday enterprise business 
processes (BPs), the right to data privacy is regulated and actively enforced in the Europe Union (EU) through the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whose aim is to protect EU 
citizens from privacy breaches. In this direction, GDPR is highly influencing the way organizations must approach data privacy, forcing them 
to rethink and upgrade their BPs in order to become GDPR compliant. For many organizations, this can be a daunting task, since little 
has been done so far to easily identify privacy issues in BPs. To tackle 
this challenge, in this paper, we provide an analysis of the main privacy 
constraints in GDPR and propose a set of design patterns to capturing 
and integrating such constraints in BP models. Using BPMN (Business 
Process Modeling Notation) as modeling notation, our approach allows 
us to achieve full transparency of privacy constraints in BPs making it 
possible to ensure their compliance with GDPR.
